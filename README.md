TO RUN REST MONGODB BACKEND: 
do python3 rest.py, the end poins would be at localhost:27017 or localhost:test . To verify mongodb structure, user MongoDB Compass for visulization or use Postman for API calls.
Only the file rest.py is for this feature. 

TO RUN USER AUTHENTICATION: 

do python3 route.py, the endpoint would be at localhost:5000, it's a demo frontend page for testing. Can be replaced with new frontend pages.
All the files except for rest.py are for the authentication feature development.
